# Purpose

This is the example project documentation for a Tribe. The home page should discuss which teams are part of the tribe and who the client is. Each Team should have a page and list the people who are part of that team.

# Key Elements of the Tribe Project Documentation

Additionally, the home page should link to an area for the tribe's [Organizational Practices](Organizational-Practices.md), [Development Practices](Development-Practices.md), and [Client Information](Client-Information.md).

Go to the [Architecture Overview](Architecture-Overview.md) to see how this application is structured at a high level

# Attribution

to help with attributing work in the project documentation; please indicate who and what team worked on authoring the page, e.g. (written by team gray @toddwseattle). Project Documentations are repos; so the commits can help with who authored what but we expect you to collaborate so the commits will only sort of be representative. If a "guild" is working on a page, create a page indicating who is in the guild that authored the page; e.g.

## Teaching Guild

| Team | Name          |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Gray | Todd Warren   |
| Gray | Paula Kayango |
